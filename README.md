### Date
The date you're submitting this.

### Location of deployed application
NA

### Time spent
How much time did you spend on the assignment? Normally, this is expressed in hours.

### Assumptions made
- The weather forecast is specifically for Vancouver.
- Users have a stable internet connection to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Users will access the application using modern web browsers.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made
- To save time, I stuck to basic UI/UX features and simplified error handling.
- While I considered accessibility, more thorough testing and adjustments could improve it further.

### Stretch goals attempted
- Used Bootstrap for most of the CSS.
- Updated the CSS to SASS for more practical usage.
- Added basic unit tests, but more comprehensive tests, including integration tests, would be ideal.

### Instructions to run assignment locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenWeatherMap API key [REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here]
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server

### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about?
- I wanted to add a search bar to make the app more practical and dynamic, not limited to one city.
- I planned to display more weather details on click for each forecast box.
- There’s potential for better error handling, such as retry logic for failed API calls.
- The UI/UX could benefit from more improvement and a more appealing design.
- I aimed to break down the WeatherForecast component into smaller ones for better maintainability and updates.

### Other information about your submission that you feel it's important that we know if applicable.
While the application meets basic requirements, I believe there's significant potential for enhancement with more time and detailed requirements.

### Your feedback on this technical challenge
I enjoyed working on this assignment as it allowed me to showcase my skills and creativity. While the current version meets the basic requirements, it doesn’t fully represent the high standards I set for my work. With more time and detailed information, I could enhance the application significantly.
